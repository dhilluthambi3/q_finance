Ahh, that makes sense now ‚Äî thanks for clarifying. Since **Qiskit jobs for finance** can run for a long time (minutes, hours, or even queued on IBMQ), you don‚Äôt want your Flask API call to sit there waiting.

You want a **job submission + async processing + later retrieval of results** workflow. This is a classic **task queue / job orchestration** problem.

---

## üîÑ Typical Workflow

1. **User submits a job** via your Flask API

   * Example: `POST /jobs` with input parameters (portfolio, risk constraints, etc.).
   * Your API saves the job metadata into a database (MongoDB) with status `"PENDING"`.
   * Then it enqueues the heavy computation into a **task queue** (Celery task with Qiskit call).
   * API returns a `job_id` immediately.

2. **Celery worker picks up the job**

   * Worker runs Qiskit computation (`qiskit.QuantumCircuit`, optimizers, etc.).
   * This could be on:

     * Same AWS instance, or
     * A more powerful compute node / GPU machine / HPC environment.
   * Worker updates job status in MongoDB: `"IN_PROGRESS"`, `"SUCCESS"`, or `"FAILED"`.

3. **User checks job status/results later**

   * Example: `GET /jobs/<job_id>`
   * Your API reads from MongoDB:

     * If `"PENDING"`/`"IN_PROGRESS"` ‚Üí return status.
     * If `"SUCCESS"` ‚Üí return results (or link to results).

## üì¶ Recommended Tech Stack

Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôd design it around your **Flask + MongoDB** base:

* **Flask API** ‚Üí for submission (`POST`) and retrieval (`GET`) endpoints.
* **Celery** ‚Üí background task runner for Qiskit computations.
* **Redis** ‚Üí task queue (fast, lightweight, standard).
* **MongoDB** ‚Üí store job metadata and results (good for long-term persistence).
* **Optional: Flower** ‚Üí monitoring dashboard for Celery tasks.

## üèóÔ∏è Example Flow

1. **POST /jobs**

   ```json
   {
     "problem_type": "portfolio_optimization",
     "params": { "assets": 5, "budget": 100 }
   }
   ```

   Response:

   ```json
   {
     "job_id": "64f92a6f",
     "status": "PENDING"
   }
   ```

2. **Celery worker runs Qiskit**

   * Does the computation (minutes‚Äìhours).
   * Writes result back into MongoDB:

     ```json
     {
       "job_id": "64f92a6f",
       "status": "SUCCESS",
       "result": {
         "optimal_portfolio": [1,0,1,0,1],
         "value": 123.45
       }
     }
     ```

3. **GET /jobs/64f92a6f**
   Response (before completion):

   ```json
   {
     "job_id": "64f92a6f",
     "status": "IN_PROGRESS"
   }
   ```

   Response (after completion):

   ```json
   {
     "job_id": "64f92a6f",
     "status": "SUCCESS",
     "result": {
       "optimal_portfolio": [1,0,1,0,1],
       "value": 123.45
     }
   }
   ```

## üîë Why this stack works

* **Flask** ‚Üí lightweight REST API.
* **Redis** ‚Üí fast job queue; workers pick tasks quickly.
* **Celery** ‚Üí proven Python library for long-running async tasks.
* **MongoDB** ‚Üí persists job state + results (users can come back hours/days later).

---

üëâ So the workflow is:
**Flask (submit job) ‚Üí Celery via Redis (async run Qiskit) ‚Üí MongoDB (store result) ‚Üí Flask (check result).**

---

Do you want me to **write a concrete code example** for this workflow (Flask + Celery + Redis + MongoDB, with a fake long Qiskit job)? That way you can directly adapt it to your quantum-finance use case.
